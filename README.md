### More description: 
I learned C language when I was in my first year. 

At the end of it, I did [a small PACMAN-like game](/Final%20presentation/final_exam_Combined/main.cpp) with my classmates. We did the main stem together, including the maps class, player class, item class, node class, linked list class, and the main(); and  each of us did the their own responsible monster.

I am in charge of the "fireball monster" and its "fireball". To see the file with only this monster, please view [this file](Final%20presentation/Personal%20code/main.cpp).

There are other projects in the "practices" directory. Please take a look if you are interested.


Throughout the course, I learned: 
* Syntax of C++
* Concepts of oop
* Linked list (data structure)
* Cooperating with others
